The person that created this repository betrayed ProdigyMathGameHacking, vandalized our website, and screwed up the email. Everything here has been removed because Mike forgot to remove me (SwxtchCode), so I just went into his "MENUS" repository and deleted everything.

If you want hacks, use <a href="https://github.com/Prodigy-Hacking/ProdigyMathGameHacking">this repository</a>.
