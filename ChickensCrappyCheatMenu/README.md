# Chicken's Crappy Cheat Menu
Hi, I'm DaChickenKing. I made this cheat menu because I have nothing to do with my life, and I want Prodigy to make an anti-cheat!

## How to Use
- Follow the [instructions to run the ProdigyMathGameHacking Redirect Hack](https://github.com/Prodigy-Hacking/ProdigyMathGameHacking/wiki/Redirect-Hack).
- Log in to Prodigy and wait for the game to load.
- Paste the code from the `loader.js` file into the console. For instructions on how to open the console, see [this](https://github.com/Prodigy-Hacking/ProdigyMathGameHacking/wiki/How-to-use-Javascript-Hacks).
- Success!

## Notes
- Will's Cheat Menu (the default menu included with the Redirect Hack) will no longer be functional when using this menu. To use Will's Cheat Menu,
 refresh the page without pasting this code into the console
