== Chicken's Crappy Cheat Menu ==
Hi, I'm DaChickenKing. I made this cheat menu because I have nothing to do with my life, and I want Prodigy to make an anti-cheat!

== How to Use ==
# Follow the [instructions to run the ProdigyMathGameHacking Redirect Hack](https://github.com/Prodigy-Hacking/ProdigyMathGameHacking/wiki/Redirect-Hack)
# Log in to Prodigy and wait for the game to load
# Paste the code from the `loader.js` file into the console. For instructions on how to open the console, see [this](https://github.com/Prodigy-Hacking/ProdigyMathGameHacking/wiki/How-to-use-Javascript-Hacks)
# Success!
